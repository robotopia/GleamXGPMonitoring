# Requirements

This app is built on the Django framework, and packaged in docker containers.
In order to run the web-app youâ€™ll need:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (v24+)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (v1.29+)

See the [Architecture description](Architecture) for more information about how the web-app is built and deployed.
