### Survey Status

![Survey Status](figures/SurveyStatusPage.png)

This page shows a table of all the observations that have been uploaded along with the number of candidates associated with each observation.
Since observations are not associated with projects (see [Session Settings](#session-settings)), this page is an unfiltered view of all observations.
The blue download button allows users to download all the observation data as a FITS table.
The downloaded data contains all the fields associated with the [observation model](databases).
