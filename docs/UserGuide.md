### Survey Status

![Survey Status](figures/SurveyStatusPage.png)

This page shows a table of all the observations that have been uploaded along with the number of candidates associated with each observation.
Since observations are not associated with projects (see [Session Settings](#session-settings)), this page is an unfiltered view of all observations.
The blue download button allows users to download all the observation data as a FITS table.
The downloaded data contains all the fields associated with the [observation model](databases).

### Candidate Table

![Candidate Ratings Table](figures/CandidateRatingsTable.png)

This page shows a table of all the candidates that belong to the currently selected project (see [Session Settings](#session-settings)).
From here you can view the candidates, sort the table using the arrows next to the various column headers, filter the table using the form above the table or download the data using the green download button.
The column titled Metadata will show a link when a candidate has metadata associated with it.

If you have not selected a project, or your selected project has no candidates, then you will see an empty table.

The download button will download only the data that matches the current filtering criteria.
If you want all data from a given project, be sure to press the "clear filter" button and apply the filter before downloading.

Clicking on the candidate Id will take you to the corresponding candidate rating page.
